**Response 2**

Refuting the Rebuttals
  
**Red vs. Hino**

Air Blades
 
  
* The 'vacuum blade' stuff is irrelevant because it contradicts several basic properties of what a vacuum entails in real life. Verlux can't prove that more complex properties of vacuums are respected by this attack when it fails to respect the basics. This is quite clearly just ol' nonsense 'fantasy' science that makes as much sense as saying 'frozen heat', 'cold fire', or 'solid gas'. RN sweeps. 
  
* The piercing resistance stuff's irrelevant. No one argued that, ain't gonna waste space on it, RN dodges this crap and sweeps. 
  
Brick
 
  * Red Ninja's stronger than you think. The dude's easily as strong as El Negron, but this is also irrelevant because even if Hino's as strong as my opponent claims him to be (he mislinks a scan, but I know what he meant to link), he can't actually hit RN. 
  
 * 'RN seemingly enjoys getting into melee fighting' Always, without exception, in conjunction with his fire manipulation. His melee hits are always used to create opportunities for him to use fire. There's no universe where RN doesn't lead this fight with fire right off the bat. 
 
**Conclusion**: The 'vacuum' shit is fake as fuck, Hino still dies.
 
Speed
 
  
\* If my opponent's words are taken at face value, Hino's speed is grossly out of tier. The feat ain't as good as he thinks it is, either. Even if it was, Hino's still constantly unable to tag Kamiizumi and only does so through a few lucky shots. He's considerably below someone who's not as fast as RN. damn bro 'amazing' speed

Fire Resist
  
\* Electrocauterization devices go up to 600-800-1200 degrees, depending on the setting. It takes several minutes of concentrated use for machines to effectively cauterize deep sword wounds like the one performed by Negron's sword, and Red does that in two seconds so he's definitely within that range.
  
\* More importantly, the entire definition of cauterization is destroying tissue in a very controlled and concentrated manner. The exact temperature of cauterization is a red herring here and doesn't really matter; it's missing the forest for the trees. RN will 'cauterize' Hino's entire goddamn body. He dies
  
\* 'The brief impacts of flame' bro this ain't gonna be a small concentrated fire like the one he uses to cauterize a friend and save their lives. He's gonna blast Hino. If, as per your own admission, Hino's to be assumed as comparable to a real human in terms of heat resistance, then RN straight up kills his ass, objectively.  (scans of Eye Blood killing Green and Negron with a single fire blast, scans of Red about to kill Blue)
  
* 'The fire has no good speed' wrong. (link scans of the fire pillar, shields, Eye Blood's fires, etc., argue scaling) 'takes time to charge' wrong, even if true Hino's slow ass ain't gonna pose any problems in the single moment it takes RN to charge up something good enough to kill him
  
RN Speed
  
* Crunch out the numbers for him I guess
  
* Make sure to preclude the 'but real time/framecalcing' thing by showing the Slow Motion scans
  
RN blasts Hino's slow ass
  
\*\*Kane vs. Kakashi\*\*
 
Speed
 
  
* its kinda funny that my opponent calls me out for making 'many goddamn assumptions' on Kakashi's feat even though I only really made one and he'd just made a ton of assumptions for the Kane feat; that's cause literary feats suck barring some specific exceptions. My feat is actually visual and demonstrative
  
\* 'Kane dodging and weaving through them all means he is reacting to them as they approach his face from relatively close range given his foe's accuracy and speed' no it doesnt, this is an assumption. It's perfectly possible for him to do so as soon as the arrow leaves the bowstring, especially considering your own argument is that the arrows are fired in coordination to the point they appear to be a conjoined missile.
  
\* 'Also, for context, they're fighting in a sparring chamber for monks and Drizzt did a single backroll to get away from Kane prior, it's not going to be a huge room lmao they fight with their fists.' Again another assumption that he can't prove. What constitutes "not a huge room"? How many meters away is he? If we assume 5m then it only requires Kane to have 50ms reactions. My opponent's probably perceiving this feat as Kane somersaulting over slow-mo arrows and leaping the same distance as they travel at nearly the same speed, but that's, once again, not something warranted.  

  
Kakashi Speed
  

 
  
\* 'lowballing Naruto's speed to 200ms is a way of making this feat in-tier' no it isn't. If I assume the peak human reaction times of 100ms it's still just a bit over 100m/s, perfectly in tier, literally the same speed I was arguing for the  other feat, and Kakashi has done this multiple times before
  
\* 'naruto vs. haku' Haku explicitly moves faster than a non-Kyuubi amped Naruto can react to & does my opponent not know the  basic principle of impermanence? If I were to calculate reactions for a feat that happened 100 chapters ago and apply it to the end of Part 1, I could just continuously wank characters' feats without them ever having to show any objective feats around that range. this is fake
  

  
Kakashi's objectively faster than Kane
  

  
Kakashi Skill
  

  
\*' Kane can complete full movements before Entreri can even register the action' that's because Entreti's prediction powers suck and Kane's faster than him lol this in no way applicable to the Sharingan
  

  
My opponent conceded that point pretty much
  

  

  
Damage Output
  
\* Kabuto's called out as being equal to Kakashi and, in one particular occasion, even outright affirmed to be no tougher than him at this point. The same Kabuto's also shown to be able to take hits like the Rasengan and blows from an angry Tsunade, who'd been explicitly trying to kill him, and during the same fight she was shown to be able to crater significant amounts of stone with her punches. There are absolutely no anti-feats in Part 1 to invalidate this scaling, so I'm very comfortable saying Kakashi is capable of replicating both of Kabuto's durability feats. Kakashi may not be as proportionately durable as Kane, but that was never a point of contention in my response, and the claim that Kakashi gets one-shot killed is false.
  

  
\* Kane uses shuriken; already responded to that preemptively and my opponent ignored it. Kakashi has encountered Shuriken a thousand times before to the point they're a non-issue even when there's no visibility. The Sharingan, again, makes this shit a non-issue. 
  

  
\*\*Durability\*\*
  
1. never argued shuriken, that's irrelevant and even if Kakashi did throw them it'd be just to test and gauge Kane's abilities at best
  
2. The Raikiri and the Chidori are the exact same technique, Kakashi just decided to change the name for shits and giggles. Sasuke's Chidori is explicitly worse than Kakashi's at this point in time. His chakra pool to power the attack is way lower than Kakashi's, he learned the technique from the guy weeks ago (at the time of my scans) and was explicitly said not to have completed it, how the fuck is his Chidori supposed to be stronger? 
  

  
Anji vs. Negron
  

  
\*\*One Tap\*\*
  

  
\* 'Anji wins if he even taps Negron briefly' my opponent then proceeds to show a scan of Anji throwing a blow with lots of momentum against Sanosuke (a guy who has never done anything to suggest he's any good at resisting internal damage) and only making him cough up blood. His own scan debunks this exaggerated claim. If a guy who's got absolutely no feats for sponging attacks that deal internal damage only got a bit wounded from Anji's Layers, then a dude who's only briefly staggered by explosions that have better collateral than all of Anji's Layer feats except for the ones where he's using his entire body to channel his shockwaves is not definitely not going to be taken out of the fight by a 'tap' lol, also Negron's fine after being shot by Gatling guns

 * 'why is it being assumed that Anji won't use his ability' who the heck said this my man? Anji will use it, but he won't get to do anything useful with it cause there's no proof he can reliably land hits on Negron. You apparently agree with me considering you still haven't given out an actual number for how fast he can move in combat. I never objected to his perception.

  
\*\*Body Mastery\*\*
  
\* 'Anji can vibrate and destroy El Negron's sword and projectiles' wrong. destroying some pebbles does not in any way imply that. Negron's DarkObscureBlack (D.O.B) energy attacks are shown to have a fire-like consistency, bordering on gaseous at times, and do not possess the same kind of tangibility as hard materials like stone; they often seem to almost phase through objects. Anji's 'Layers' ability has only ever worked against things like stone, wood, and metals; semi-intangible energy attacks with gaseous, air-like consistency is something he's never interacted with. (show scans of Negron sinking into the ground)
  
\* 'Negron can bust earth with rocks' the material is clearly stone, not earth, as shown from the rubble. The narrator himself states it's stone; in the scene right after Negron busts some more rock, we see the Green Ninja grab rubble from the material he displaced with his attack, which is outright referred to as a 'pedra', ie a stone.
  

  
\*\*Comparative Speed\*\*
  

  
\* Verlux refuses to quantify Anji's movement speed and instead addresses something I never questioned, his reactions. The reason for that is cause it's either really bad or OOT lol
  
\* Crunch out the numbers again I guess
  

  
\*\*Anji Endurance\*\*
  

  
\* My wording clearly let on that this was a generous, best-case-scenario assessment for Anji, so no, I didn't let on shit, and punching people on the chin is not out-of-character for Negron either.
  

  
\*\*Conclusion\*\*: literally nothing has changed, and Negron's supremacy in the wincon department has gone unaddressed. He still has complete dominance over the field, the movement speed advantage, and a myriad ways to kill Anji (Bankai for one)
