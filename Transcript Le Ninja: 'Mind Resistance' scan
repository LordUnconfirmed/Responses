I had a lot of plans for Le Ninja Fighter, many of them involving the Black Ninja. 

The protagonist of LNF is, of course, the Blue Ninja. The series was already heading in that direction before I stopped animating it, but of course the Black Ninja was a big fan favorite too and I planned some good moments with him. For example, he would defeat one of Blood in the Eye's minions and we'd have a whole episode just for that fight. Towards the end, when Zalgo's last key was released, Blood in the Eye would use his powers to control the minds of everyone in the capital, even Sensei himself, but one of the few immune would be the Black Ninja, precisely because of the powers of the DarkObscureBlack. He would help the Blue Ninja rid the others of the 'spell'

Who knows, maybe one day the series will come back on the channel, right?
