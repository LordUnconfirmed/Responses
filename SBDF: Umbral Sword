'Umbral Sword
- Ninja Negro's sword, which is not really a 'sword' so much as a physical manifestation of dark energy created via the DarkObscureBlack in order to act as an 'energy catalyser'. 
- Besides being sharp enough to cut even rocks and large boulders in half with ease, it also possesses the secret power to cut and absorb the life energy and the soul of any being who's touched by its blade, making it lethal and useful against even the most invulnerable of foes.
