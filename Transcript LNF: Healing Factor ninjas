It's curious, really, as I even planned for a second that Sensei would die not long after the fight against Dolan from a mortal wound, even though he defeated him. And, well, in this fucking series it's not really necessary to have consistency, but that would have been a bit of a waste for the character (had I continued) and it would also have gone against the idea I had that all Ninjas have a certain degree of regenerative healing ability (as you saw with the Blue Ninja at the end of the first episode), like regenerating holes in the body, or limbs, other than the head or the brain...so I kind of abandoned that idea right away lol, and shortly afterwards I ended up abandoning the series itself.
