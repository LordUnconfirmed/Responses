Ame vs. Amasian
Amasian R1
Shang vs. Batman
•	Shang’s bullet speed feats are a lot better than Batman’s arrow feats
•	Batman’s striking is comparable to what Shang has taken and he can redirect hits
•	Shang’s strength is enough to hurt Batman and their efficiency will be compounded by him striking at weakpoints
•	Shang is at least equal to Batman in skill and can counter much of his martial arts
•	Stealth bad against Shang
•	Shang better at martial arts and prediction
Choso vs. Roland
•	Literature feats bad
•	Choso’s got clear scaling to bullet timers and supersonic folks
•	Guys who Choso scales favorably to can act in 10ms while Roland’s described as acting in 25ms
•	Roland durability bad
•	Roland striking not provably good and piercing doesn’t matter because regeneration
•	Choso blood OP, tracks and poisons and debilitates, Roland won’t be able to fight for long
Taiyo vs. Sara
•	Taiyo can tank literally everything Sara can throw his way
•	Taiyo fast enough to keep up
•	Sara durability bad, Taiyo striking good
Ame R1
Batman vs. Shang
•	Nice stats comparison chart
•	Batman’s striking is slightly better than blows that left Shang reeling on his ass for several seconds
•	Shang’s defenses against piercing will not consistently matter in the face of Batman’s skill
•	Shang has no real counter to knockout gas
•	Batman’s durability is considerably better than Shang’s striking
•	The arrow feat’s better than it appears to be at a first glance
•	Batman’s skill will avail him better than Shang’s due to the circumstances
•	Stealth actually matters
Choso vs. Roland
•	More cool statposts
•	Roland can do some damage to Choso with his strikes and kill him with piercing
•	Choso has not a single poison or gas resistance feat
•	Roland can shrug off hits
•	Roland piercing resistance OP
•	Even when pierced he can still fight just as good
•	Yoji’s speed scaling is not actually that good or clear-cut compared to Roland’s feats
Sara vs. Taiyo
•	Statposting 3: Revenge of the Unquantified
•	Taiyo can’t actually tank everything Sara does
•	Sara’s speed is hella better
•	Sara has the AOE advantage via energy blasts and her tendrils
Notes: Both of them establish their characters’ abilities rather well in this round. I think the nitpicks of how precisely well Shang and/or Batman can strike do not matter that much because both are clearly comparable in that department; I also have to point out that I think Ame going ‘this literature feat is CLEAR-CUT’ was a bad move on his part. Although these feats do put Roland solidly in-tier, they’re not ‘clearly’ putting him above Choso, as claimed. It'd be a simple move to cast doubt on that claim. T’was a bad move to leave Taiyo's piercing resistance unaddressed when it's such an integral wincon element.
