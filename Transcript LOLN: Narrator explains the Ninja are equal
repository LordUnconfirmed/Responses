Note:
The Ninja are all nearly equivalent to each in terms of power, with slight variances depending on their emotional state (in other words, if they're really fucking mad), but the Red Ninja uses up all of his power at once, like an explosion. He quite literally does not give a fuck, thus he's always running out of energy and falling asleep, almost into a coma. It's possible, however, that he uses it up like that on purpose, just so he can sleep, really. He's a certified son of a bitch.
